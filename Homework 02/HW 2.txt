For each of the following three exercises,

A) Estimate the simple linear regression equation. (5pts each)
B) Construct the scatterplot between the predictor variable X and the response variable Y, and draw the fitted regression equation on the scatterplot. (abline function) (13pts each)
C) Comment on the fitted regression equation (from part (b) above).Interpret the estimated intercept and slope in the context of the problem. (15pts each)
